## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- javaScript

### What I learned

This challenge was a bit difficult for me as it is the first time I tried combining using Json file and api. At the end I learnt how to fetch data from an Api and use the data to update my json file and also configure my project in such a way that if the api fails to connect the site still loads from my json file.

### Continued development

I intend to keep taking up projects like this and more to help further improve my javaScript skills and also build CRUD Apps.
