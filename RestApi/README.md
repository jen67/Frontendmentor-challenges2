## Overview

This project is a solution to the REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor. The goal was to create a web application where users can explore countries using data from the REST Countries API and toggle between light and dark modes.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This challenge introduced me to the process of integrating JSON files and APIs. Despite its initial difficulty, I successfully implemented fetching data from an API and updating a JSON file with it. Additionally, I learned how to handle API connection failures gracefully, ensuring that the site can still function using data from the JSON file.

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to further enhance my JavaScript skills and expand my knowledge by building CRUD applications.
